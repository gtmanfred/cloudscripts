# Cloud Scripts

## How to use?

I was tired of having to rewrite the same api call every day when I was doing
different things with apis on openstack.  The auth.py provides an easy
implementation of login, and I plan on writting more api libs as I need to.

Each script will have a description at the top, and an example of how to run it.
It also has a list of python requirements that you can install with your package
manager or with pip if you use a virtualenv.

I highly recommend [virtualenvwrappers](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.org/en/latest/), it is a really nice tool.
